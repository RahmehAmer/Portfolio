i'm building a portfolio website for myself consisting of 1 page with multiple sections. note: Use the same template, layout, colors, spacing, and overall design i provided you exactly as the original.
Do not change the UI or visual structure.
Only update the content based on the information I provide.
I removed the “Experience” section and replaced it with an “Education” section.
Please add the Education section in the same style as the other sections and keep the design consistent.
Keep everything else unchanged.
